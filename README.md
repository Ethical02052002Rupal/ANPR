Whenever a vehicle passes an ANPR camera, the photograph is captured, its registration number is read and instantly verified against database records of
blacklisted vehicles. Police officers gets the blacklisted vehicle number from the proposed system and traces the blacklisted vehicle movement from camera
location and timestamp. A record for all vehicles passing by a camera is stored, including those for vehicles that are not known to be of interest at the time of the
read that may in appropriate circumstances be accessed for investigative purposes.
